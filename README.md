## Code Organization
* `algebra/`: Contains implementation of quaternion types subspaces in Clifford algebra.
* `data/`: Contains data loading scripts for experiments.
* `engineer/`: Contains training, evaluation, and visualization scripts.
* `experiments/`: Contains experiments on GLGENN.
* `layers/`: Contains architecture of GLGENN layers.
* `models/`: Contains models built from GLGENN layers.

## Experiments
* O(5) and O(7) regression tasks: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iwVSXqOToJhCDZ56_bOAAVINKsBizbDj?usp=sharing)
